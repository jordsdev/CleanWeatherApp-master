# CleanWeatherApp 
A Clean Weather App

I'm Trying to Get this simple clean weather app in Kotlin to work and i cant. 

What im trying to do is...

Weather page... Get weather data for a certain city which is typed in the searchview on the weather page layout. 

Also if possible using the my location check box.

The data is coming from 'https://openweathermap.org/' of which i have an API key for. 

Im looking for someone to help me get that working.

Also if someone could help me get the Sunrise page working its the same thing. 

This time using 'https://sunrise-sunset.org/'

A search for a city and then a button which on button click finds that cities sunset and sunrise info for that day.

Again would be good if the my location check box worked with the API and button.

Also if anyone has any suggestions they can add what they want if its going to add value. 

Thanks and i look forward to learning how to get this working. Cheers.
